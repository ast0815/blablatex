# blablatex
Check your latex document for bullshit with the BlaBlaMeter

See [blablameter.com](http://www.blablameter.com) for details about the index.

Only textblocks that do *not* start with an '%' or an '\' will be annotated.
You also need to 'annotate' the tex-file that contains your `\documentclass`
and `\begin{document}` lines.
